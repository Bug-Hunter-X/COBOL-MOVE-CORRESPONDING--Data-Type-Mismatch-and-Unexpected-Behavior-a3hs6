# COBOL MOVE CORRESPONDING Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `MOVE CORRESPONDING` statement in COBOL when used with data structures that are not perfectly aligned.  Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected truncation or corruption of data.  The provided example highlights the importance of ensuring strict data type compatibility and structure consistency before employing this statement.

## Bug Description

The `MOVE CORRESPONDING` statement simplifies data transfer between similar structures. However, if the source and target structures have data fields of different types or lengths, unexpected data manipulation may occur.   Specifically, truncation of numeric values or inaccurate alphanumeric conversions can result. This example shows how this subtle error can lead to difficult-to-debug problems.

## Solution

To prevent data corruption, ensure the source and target structures have exactly matching field names, data types, and lengths. Manual data transfers or more targeted `MOVE` statements should be used for selective data transfer where the structures are only partially similar.  Thorough testing and validation of field sizes are crucial in preventing this.
